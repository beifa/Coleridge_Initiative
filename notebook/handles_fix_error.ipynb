        "text_fix = 'Susan Hallamand Kevin Rogers relationship between third-and fourth-grade students academic achievement and their participation in music programmes. This was moderated by the quality of the programme; the higher the quality of the programme, the higher the academic attainment. Research based on standardized verbal and mathematics achievement tests in the USA has shown that children who have participated in music courses while in high school perform better with the number of years engaged in music correlated with test performance (Catterall, 1998) . Those young musicians who participate in state wide ensembles also have higher SAT scores than state averages (DeCarbo, Fiese & Boyle, 1990; Henry & Braucht, 2007) . Schellenberg (2006) also showed that music training was associated positively with children performance in school and that those who took music lessons over relatively long periods of time tended to be particularly successfully even when intelligence was controlled for. However, not all of the research supports these findings. Miksza (2007) , using data from National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 with a sample of 5335, created a composite item which assessed student participation in music for the entire duration of the study from eighth to 12 th grade and measured academic achievement in mathematics, reading comprehension, science and social studies. There were significant differences for all subtests in the initial testing in favour of those who had participated in band, choir or orchestra, but rates of change in mathematics, science and social studies were no greater for the music participants. Indeed, in reading achievement the music participants increased more slowly than non-participants. In a later study Miszka (2010) using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, taking account of a wider range of variables studied the impact of musical engagement on standardized mathematics scores and found that students in high-school music ensembles were more likely to have higher standardised mathematics achievement scores.Also in the USA, Southgate and Roscigno (2009) -using two national data sets, ECLS-K (20,000 US kindergarten students) and NELS:88 (25,000 adolescents), and three measures of music participation (in school, outside school and parental involvement in the form of concert attendance) -found that music involvement varied systematically by class and gender status. Involvement had implications for both mathematics and reading achievement for young children and adolescents and associations between music and achievement persisted even when prior achievement was taken into account. Musical engagement generally increased achievement levels, although gains were not distributed equally among all students; a white student advantage existed.'\n",

              "\"18 F]flutemetamol PET scan in this group led mainly to a diagnosis of prodromal AD/AD, while a negative scan, with a few exceptions, led to a diagnosis of non-AD/dementia NOS, or (in a subset of MCI patients) to retention of the original diagnosis. Overall, amyloid PET led to a significant change in diagnosis in 44% of patients and an increase in the use of AD drug treatment, from 34 to 109 of 207 patients (16% to 53%). On the basis of our study design, in which amyloid PET results were used to revise initial diagnoses and treatment plans, our findings provide an estimate of the incremental value of this type of investigation in the clinical setting. Thus, this study fulfils the requirements of a phase 4 study as defined by the five-phase biomarker validation framework recently introduced to the field [34, 35] . This type of study is vital to assess the utility of amyloid PET and to accelerate the development of evidence-based guidelines for its clinical use [36] .\\nIn the present study, the concordance rates observed between [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET and CSF Aβ were lower than those reported to date from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and the Swedish BioFINDER (Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably) studies [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , in which the composition of the cohorts largely resembles that found in clinical trials. The difference in observations is due to the fact that in the present study only patients with an unclear diagnosis following extensive assessment were recruited for amyloid imaging. Although our study, by design, was predisposed to discordance, it draws attention to potential complications in implementing the recent AD biomarker classification scheme [42] : based on categorical and biomarker analyses, this framework assumes that measures of amyloid based on CSF analysis and PET are interchangeable. Although disagreement between imaging and CSF analysis may be a reflection of how cut-off values are established-with European laboratories generally using Aβ 1-42 cut-off values that are too low [18] the use of a more lenient cut-off value (647 ng/L) derived from a recent study using the same CSF INNOTEST assay [40] resulted in the same overall level of concordance; though an increase in concordant-positive subjects was seen, this was accompanied by an increase in the number of subjects showing isolated CSF positivity. There is evidence, however, to suggest that higher cut-off values for Aβ 1-42 may prove appropriate. Further studies addressing this, including comparison with Aβ 1-42 /tau ratios, are warranted. While many subjects may show concordance in the long term [42] , more work is required to integrate and compare CSF analysis and amyloid PET so as to develop more refined guidelines for how these biomarkers are to be used and interpreted in the diagnostic work-up of patients with dementia disorders [43] , including considerations related to differences in amyloid processing and neurodegeneration seen across atypical forms of AD [44] and the value of Aβ 1-42 ratios with shorter isoforms [45, 46] and tau/Aβ 1-42 [47] .\\nThe percentage of patients with a change in diagnosis observed in this study (44%) was higher than the average of those found in previous studies [48] , although somewhat lower than in other studies [10, 11] . This most likely reflects differences in the composition of the study cohorts; in the present study, diagnostic uncertainty remained despite extensive neuropsychological testing, imaging and biomarker investigations. Our study cohort therefore most likely included a higher proportion of patients with atypical disease, an assertion supported by the number of MCI and dementia NOS patients with an unchanged diagnosis. We consider, however, that the most important finding was the high percentage of amyloid-positive MCI patients who received a change in diagnosis to prodromal AD or AD, and thus began treatment with ChEIs. Although currently not included in the appropriate use criteria for amyloid PET [49] , patients with SCD are increasingly discussed as an at-risk population given the association between SCD and cognitive decline in the context of biomarker evidence for AD [50, 51] . Indeed, our findings that most such patients showed abnormal CSF findings and clinical progression at follow-up suggest that this group is important in the context of best practice guidelines.\\nIn our cohort, amyloid PET led to significant changes in the management of patients, including treatment with ChEIs, with a more than threefold increase in the number of patients receiving ChEI treatment. This increase was primarily accounted for by amyloid-positive patients with a diagnosis after [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET of prodromal AD/ AD. Similarly, amyloid-positive patients with a diagnosis after [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET of AD comprised the majority of those receiving ChEIs prior to undergoing amyloid PET. The small number of [\\n18 F]flutemetamol-positive MCI and non-AD (DLB) patients receiving cholinergic drugs probably reflects varying adherence by physicians to the diagnostic codes (i.e. MCI, amyloid-positive, versus prodromal AD, a research term not currently recognized in dementia care guidelines) and evidence suggesting that this drug class is of benefit in DLB [52] . Among the few amyloid-negative patients, treatment, whether initiated prior to or after [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET, was related to CSF Aβ 1-42 positivity (seen in close to half of such patients) and/or physicianspecific treatment beliefs.\\nThe present study underlines the value of amyloid PET when CSF biomarkers are not consistent or when CSF sampling is not possible due to the use of anti-coagulants, other medical reasons, or patient refusal of lumbar puncture. In this population of patients it has also been demonstrated that [ 18 F]FDG PET is not always useful, especially in those with MCI. A negative amyloid PET study is important information for an MCI patient and often results in a decease in the use of resources due to fewer ancillary investigations. In patients with aetiologically unclear dementia or non-AD, amyloid PET could provide important diagnostic information, as was illustrated in the present study with a 55% change in diagnosis among dementia NOS patients. Although the fact that the generally rather extensive investigations undergone by the patients in this study help to establish the clinical usefulness of [\\n18 F]flutemetamol PET, it must also be underlined that our findings may not be generalizable to older patients or those attending less specialized clinical centres. Although incorporating costeffectiveness parameters associated with amyloid imaging was beyond the scope of the present investigation, further studies addressing this, including the optimal stage (early versus late) for the use of amyloid PET in the diagnostic work-up of patients, are crucial.\""
