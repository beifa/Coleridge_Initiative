remained unclear while direct measurements satellite data numerical models and proxy reconstructions have advanced our presentday knowledge of current movements and transport variability in recent decades there is still a need for multidecadal high resolution on site lst records to better understand its interannual variation this study presents annually resolved histories of mean transport variability across the ls based on coral radiocarbon c records in this approach we aim to investigate how the surface transport across the ls has changed in the past years moreover we aim to provide insights on the possible mechanisms that drive its variability this information is critical to understanding the causes and impacts of long term ocean circulation variability in this region c coral is not affected by biological process thus they provide a conservative tracer of ocean circulation dunbar cole coral c records of various temporal resolution and length are available in the wpo scs and indonesia regions figure these records provide histories of basin scale changes in ocean circulation since the beginning of the twentieth century in conjunction with our coral c records we take advantage of this extensive spatial and temporal information to examine the interaction between the wpo and the scs through the ls c with lower c values and the observed dampening in c seasonality at this site however since the ls is a site of water mass exchange between the scs and the wpo the c values at our sites must be additionally affected by the c variability between these basins the occurrence of early bomb peaks in both houbihu and palaui c records indicates influence of the western pacific circulation across the ls relative to air sea co exchange which typically takes a decade nydal the quick c rise in houbihu and palaui recorded year after the initial bomb detonations is likely due to a nuclear fallout signal distributed by the advection of tropical pacific currents i e nec and kc originating at the testing sites at bikini and enewetak atolls andrews et al glynn et al this current system delivers bomb contaminated nec waters through guam with a current speed of to m s until it bifurcates to the northward flowing kc and the southward flowing mc whose speeds are roughly to times faster andrews et al lien et al qu et al figure the difference in the transport velocities between the nec and its branches i e kc and mc explains the year lag time between the initial detonations and the early bomb peaks in the coral records in the pacific the interannual variability of the location and speed of the western boundary currents are strongly influenced by enso y y kim et al qiu chen to further investigate this control on the c variability at our sites during the post bomb period i e after we compared our results with guam c since the kuroshio waters reaching our sites originate from the nec that flow by guam figure a and the southern oscillation index y y kim et al during el ni o years the northward nbl position causes less nec water to flow northward to the kc relative to the southward flow east of mindanao y y kim et al qiu chen qiu lukas due to the dampened winds the nec and kuroshio velocities are slower and transports are at their minimum during el ni o y y kim et al qiu chen qiu lukas this leads to a positive palaui guam c difference and is opposite of what the above mechanism predicts this period coincides with the broad c plateau recorded in guam andrews et al the cause of the small c variability after the bomb peak in guam is not well understood andrews et al however the higher face flow across the strait and surface circulation in the scs are strongly dependent on the asian monsoon system e g centurioni et al g chen hu et al hsin et al metzger hurlburt nan et al qu et al qu et al tian et al p x wang li wyrtki yang et al during winter the prevailing northeast monsoon winds drive surface water flow westward across the strait the general surface circulation within the scs is also cyclonic during this period figure during summer the general surface circulation involves a cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation in the northern and southern scs region respectively figure between the winter and summer monsoon systems the east asian winter monsoon eawm has a greater impact on the westward flow across the strait and circulation within the scs hsin et al to examine the monsoonal control on the circulation and c variability between our sites and the scs records we similarly calculated the interannual c difference between houbihu c and con dao hon tre and currimao con dao sits on a continental shelf in shallow waters and is mainly impacted by atmospheric c processes mitsuguchi et al in contrast hon tre and currimao are monsoon driven sites with seasonal upwelling and advection impacting c southeast monsoon winds blow parallel to the vietnam coast at hon tre driving summer upwelling at this site c in currimao shows significant correspondence with the strength of the winter monsoon winds hirabayashi yokoyama suzuki miyairi aze siringan maeda which drives upwelling and c variability along the northwest coast of luzon shaw et al due to these site attributes only the c difference between houbihu and currimao shows a significant relationship with the eawm winds e g d arrigo et al with a year lag r p n figure b because of westward intrusions across the strait and upwelling offshore of currimao during stronger positive eawm periods the c difference between houbihu and currimao is positive i e houbihu currimao conversely the scs outflow is more evident during weak eawm periods leading to a negative houbihu currimao c difference i e houbihu currimao the slower currents within the strait and in the northern scs region i e maximum of m s j hu et al nan et al compared with the surrounding waters may explain the year delay across the strait the interannual c difference between houbihu and palaui is significantly correlated with enso e g ni o with a year lag r p n figure c the negative correlation indicates that large small c differences i e greater lesser than coincide with el ni o la ni a years the influence of enso to the c difference between our sites may lie on the meridional pressure difference across the strait soda derived sea surface height ssh anomalies an indicator of pressure difference see details in figures and s show a significant negative correlation with enso from to r p n figure c the negative relationship indicates that el ni o la ni a years coincide with lower higher ssh anomalies since the mean ssh in the western pacific is higher than that of the scs figure a higher ssh across our sites must be due to the piling up of water across the strait during la ni a the enhanced trade winds push more water toward the western pacific leading to higher sshs in this region indicating presence of the ki along the strait nan et al nan et al and thus smaller c differences between our houbihu and palaui sites conversely due to the relaxed trade winds during el ni o the western pacific warm pool spreads toward the east flattening the ssh in this region and increasing the c difference between our sites other satellite altimetry studies along the strait have shown that ssh anomalies in conjunction with density stratification data are indicative of the presence or absence of the ki along the strait e g decarlo et al however whether the ki penetrates into the scs based on the above c differences remains ambiguous overall basin specific processes controlling the c variability of the ls sites are evident from quantifying the c difference between our sites and other c records in the region palaui c relative to that of jc c values are the least constrained through time adding additional uncertainty the net lateral exchange rate k lat is significantly correlated with enso r p n figure indicating its influence in driving the transport variability across the strait higher lower k lat generally coincides with el ni o la ni a periods highlighting enso s role in the meridional shifts of the nec bifurcation latitude and subsequent transport across the ls during el ni o the northward position of the nec bifurcation latitude leads to weaker kuroshio and stronger intrusion across the strait figure the reverse is expected during la ni a conditions however in however in however in however in however in however in however in however in and and show higher k lat values the observed k lat anomalies at beginning of the record may be impacted by the postbomb peak c distribution that is not advection related as previously discussed because the eawm is shown to exert influence on the westward transport across the strait we also compared these anomalous years with the eawm index and found that the weaker stronger monsoon strength in and may explain the above discrepancies weaker eawm during an el ni o event may indicate the relative dominance of k so to k ki in a stronger eawm during a la ni a event on the other hand may enhance overall k lat across the strait however the negative relationship between enso and eawm is not consistent for each enso period such that not all weak strong eawm coincides with el ni o la ni a years e g d arrigo et al the pdo may impact the enso eawm relationship e g j w kim et al l wang et al and hence the lateral transport across the strait e g wu wu et al however we do not find a significant relationship between enso and the eawm at different pdo phases and between k lat and pdo p due to the length of the record the interdecadal modulation of the pdo may not be apparent nevertheless the time varying response of the eawm to enso regardless of the pdo phase gives indication of the secondary control of the reversing monsoons over the lateral advection across the strait c is lower compared to palaui philippines both houbihu and palaui c records show early bomb produced spikes as a result of a nuclear fallout signal carried by the tropical pacific western boundary currents the early c spikes at our sites and the wpo records indicate that circulation in the c difference between these sites shows a significant relationship with the eawm the main driver of the scs general circulation and alternating flow patterns across the strait while the enso driven pressure difference between our sites offers support on the occurrence of ki across the strait whether ki reaches the scs remains unclear in conjunction with other c records in the region we were able to calculate the changes in the lateral transport across the strait the mean amount of water exchanged across the strait from after the postbomb peak is sv ranging from to sv where a positive negative value indicates net flow into out of the scs by shifting the position of the nec bifurcation latitude enso plays a critical role on the interannual variability of water mass exchange across the ls and circulation and water mass renewal in the scs'"
